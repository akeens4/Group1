#Pseudocode for largest number
#Exercise 4.21
#Assume the largest number is equal to zero
#Prompt the user to input ten integers
#As the user is inputing the numbers, compare the numbers with the initial largest number value
#If the current number is larger that the initial or previous largest number, the current largest number should displace the previos one
#Then print out the standing largest number

#Pseudocode for exercise4.19
#Sales Commission Calculator
#Regular Pay (RP) = $200
#Input the total amount of item sold for the week
#Extra Pay (EP)= 0.09 * total amount of item sold for the week
#Total earnings for the week = RP + EP

#Pseudocode for exercise 4.20
#Salary Calculator
#Input number of hours worked
#Input the hourly rate
#Regular Pay (RP) = 40 * hourly rate
#Initialize Extra Pay(EP) = 0
#If number of hours worked is greater than 40
#do this; ExtraHours = hours worked - 40
#Therefore (EP) = ExtraHours * hourlyRate * 1.5
#Gross Pay (GP)= EP + RP

#Pseudocode for exercise 4.22
#Tabular Output
#Number of times n = 5
#For the first colomn print out N
#For the second colomn multiply N by 10
#For the third colomn multiply N by 100
#Fourth colon multiply N by 1000 
#Print out each iteration value of N and the evaluations above
#While n <= 5 repeat the steps above starting from n =1 


#Pseudocode for exercise4.30
#Palindrome
#Prompt the user to input a 5 digit number
#If the user inputs a number that is more than 5 digit or less than 5 digit display error message and prompt #the user for a new number
#reverse the number i.e make the first nummber the 5th number and make the second number the 4th number
#Store the number in a variable
#If the reversed number is equal to the original number i.e the number inputed by the user then it is a #palindrone. Hence, print out it is a palindrome.
#Else if they are not equal. Print out it is not a palindrome.
